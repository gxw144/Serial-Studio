/**
 * @brief The Export class
 *
 * The CSV export class receives data from the @c IO::Manager class and
 * exports the received frames into a CSV file selected by the user.
 *
 * CSV-data is generated periodically each time the @c Misc::TimerEvents
 * low-frequency timer expires (e.g. every 1 second). The idea behind this
 * is to allow exporting data, but avoid freezing the application when serial
 * data is received continuously.
