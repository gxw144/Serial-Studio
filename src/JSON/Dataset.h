/**
 * @brief The Dataset class
 *
 * The dataset class represents the properties and values of an
 * individual data unit.
 *
 * For example, supose that you are reading the values of a temperature
 * sensor. In this case, the dataset could have the following values:
 *
 * - Value: 21
 * - Units: Â°C
 * - Title: External temperature
 * - Widget: "bar"
 * - Graph: true
 * - Max: 100
 * - Min: -15
 * - Alarm: 45
 *
 * Description for each field of the dataset class:
 * - Value: represents the current sensor reading/value.
 * - Units: represents the measurement units of the reading.
 * - Title: description of the dataset.
 * - Widget: widget that shall be used to represents the value,
 *           for example, a level widget, a gauge, a compass, etc.
 * - Graph: if set to true, Serial Studio shall plot the value in
 *          realtime.
 * - Max: maximum value of the dataset, used for gauges & bars.
 * - Min: minimum value of the dataset, used for gauges & bars.
 * - Alarm: if the value exceeds the alarm level, bar widgets
 *          shall be rendered with a dark-red background.
 *
 * @note All of the dataset fields are optional, except the "value"
 *       field and the "title" field.
